**GeneralUpdate.SystemService Publish/Deploy**

GeneralUpdate.SystemService is a Windows system service, not a web API deployed on the server. Its main purpose is to listen for the update process and restore after an update crash.

**Publish：**

It is recommended to release a single file, if you want to release the AOT version, you need to remove the mapping code from the source code.

```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true --self-contained true
```

**Create/deploy Windows services：**

```shell
sc create MyWorkerService binPath="C:\your_path\GeneralUpdate.SystemService.exe"
```

**Start the deployed Windows service：**

```shell
sc start GeneralUpdate.SystemService
```

**Delete the deployed Windows service：**

```shell
sc delete GeneralUpdate.SystemService
```
